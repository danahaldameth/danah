<h1>About the Site</h1>

<h4>Our site is here to provide you with safety tips when caring for your loving feline. There are many chemicals in cat products that may harm your cat but you may not realize it. Here we like to inform you of ways to organically raise and grow your cat without harsh chemicals or harming foods. We hope that being here on this site with us gives you better insight on feline safety and preventing any harm from ever reaching your furry feline friend. 20 percent of our profits head toward PETA and saving cats that are out of shelters. We also accept donations at donate@felinesafety.com.</h4>

<h4>This all began 5 years ago when one of our cofounders Mary Ann Jenkinson lost her cat due to using a shampoo that had been recalled and it opened her eyes to the dangers around in the animal world of products. She then gathered her closest friends as well as some professionals and decided to open up this small organization. And since then the feedback has been worthwhile. We are currently working on a partnership with creating another organization geared more toward dogs and canines. As well as one geared toward other pet types. Our goal is to make sure we are prodviding the very best and that nothing is causing harm to any animals life.</h4>
