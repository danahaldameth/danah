                  <p class="card-text"></p>
                  <p class="card-text family-serif">As a animal specialist and doctor, I'm always trying to work with animals and gets what's best for them. One day a client of mine told me how they discovered this site and how it helped them self treat some stool issues their cat was having and I found it amazing. I asked her for the site and later that evening checked it out on my own. That was 2 years ago. Since then I've been constantly reccomending this site to any cat owner clients I have and even to friends and family. Feline Safety is working on something to collaborate with my practice so we can start selling some of their items in my own office and it's going to really change the productual game. For owners to be able to go online and find tips and forums and products that are organic and at a great price is like no other thing I have seen in all my years. I only hope everyone else hopes the best for their pets as well. I myself use this site for my own cats and Im always impressed with how rich and fresh their products are. They are a diamond in the small business industry. The vetinary world dealing with felines owes a big thank you to them.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"></p>
                            <p class="card-text family-serif">What your cat eats is very important to its entire health. Its important for your foods to be organic and hold more water than oil. Dry foods should be friendly your kittens teeth and promote roughage and growrth where as wet foods should lubricate the stomach lines and provide proteins. Remember too much wet food will weaken and harm ur kittens litter so divide the income of wet and dry.It's important for your cat to gather roughage and protein in their food. We are currently working on providing and packaging organic dry and wet foods soon for purchase but until then we reccomend using any brand that has a trusted organic seal.</p>

                                      <p class="card-text"></p>
                                      <p class="card-text family-serif">When I began this organization I never thought I would end up here. We have made so much progress and gotten featured in so many magazines and vets love us around the world. I'm glad we have had such an impact on the lives of others and their feline friends. I think it's so important for our pets to be treated as best as we can and with care toward what goes on their furs and in their systems. I myself have struggled with this personally when I lost my own feline friend to a harmful product and although compensated I always thought about how I wasn't the only person who went through this and how many were bound to end up where I was and I did not want anyone to feel like I did. Feline Safety is a small organization made from love and all of our staff cares so much about cats and their safety and how those interact with them. I hope this website has some impact on your life and your felines. And I hope dog owners will be there when we open up Canine Safety launching mid 2020. I want to thank anyone who has had any impact on this site whether it be reading it or purchasing or anything that has had some impact. And even to those who went on here but did not find it enjoyable or to their liking, I thank all who gave us a chance. We hope to continue to impress our audience and bring in more readers and health enthusiasts.</p>
